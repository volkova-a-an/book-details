#This is not JSON (even though it looks deliberately similar), it is a GraphQL query. It basically says:
#
#query a book with a specific id
#get me the id, name, pageCount and author from that book
#for the author I want to know the firstName and lastName

{
    bookById(id: "book-2"){
        id
        name
        pageCount
        author {
            firstName
            lastName
        }
    }
}
