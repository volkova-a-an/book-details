# GraphQL is that it is statically typed
# This schema defines one top level field (in the type Query): bookById which returns the details of a specific book.

# queries a book by the book id
type Query {
    bookById(id: ID): Book
}

# It also defines the type Book which has the fields: id, name, pageCount and author.
type Book {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    pageCount: Int
    author: Author
}

#author is of type Author, which is defined after Book.

type Author {
    id: ID!
    firstName: String!
    lastName: String!
}
input AuthorInput {
    id: ID!
    firstName: String!
    lastName: String!
}

type Mutation {
    createBook(id: String!, name: String!, pageCount: Int, author: AuthorInput):Book
}
